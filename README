XML-Entities

This module provides a mapping from the standard XML entities to their Unicode
characters. A function for decoding is provided. The mapping can be generated
from a DTD file with entity definitions.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

The "make" command (without specified target) builds the module. In this phase,
the entities are downloaded from the web (w3.org site by default). The script
doing this (download-entities.pl) can be tweaked by arguments and environment
variables. To enable interactivity during download and to set the timeout to 10
seconds, the installation procedure would look like this:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make INTERACTIVE=1 DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT=10
    make test
    make install

To rebuild the entity definitions, run

    perl download-entities.pl > XML/Entities/Data.pm
