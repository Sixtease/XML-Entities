=head1 Description

This module is a bunch of hashes encapsulated by subroutines
that map XML entity names to their unicode characters (or strings).
It should be used from the XML::Entities module or the hashes
it provides can be passed to HTML::Entities::_decode_entities.

The data can be re-generated when definitions are changed or altered
or when you want to use another set that is defined someplace
online in an .ent file (of type DTD). See the download-entities.pl
script.
